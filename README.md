## Hi there, I'm HugoðŸ‘‹ 
I am a passionate full-stack web developer who loves to learn new technologies. I feel most at home with back-end development, but also dabbled with front-end development, including WPF and Vue.js. I also love to write optimized low-level code in C++ or C# when the situation calls for it.

I am currently
- ðŸ“š Student for Computer Science for Technical Systems @HAW Hamburg
- ðŸ’¼ Full-stack dev @OTTO
- :de: Living in Hamburg, Germany

I organize my repos into two orgs
1. All my university repos are public, they can be found at [@hugopp-uni](https://github.com/hugoppp-uni)
1. When I learn something in my free time, I archive the repo in [@hugopp-learning](https://github.com/hugoppp-learning)
    - I also keep a list of things I might want to learn in the future [here](https://github.com/users/hugoppp/projects/2)

#### ðŸ•– My most used languages since Feb 2021
