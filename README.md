## Hi there, I'm HugoðŸ‘‹ 
I am a passionate full-stack web developer who loves to learn new technologies. My focuss lies on web backend and high performance low level code, but I can also work on frontend related task when needed.

Things I live by:
- "Patterns exist to make your lives easier. If the pattern make a your life harder, stop using it"
- KISS & YAGNI
- Move fast & iterate 
- E2E typesafty above all else


I keep personal learning projects in [@hugopp-learning](https://github.com/hugoppp-learning) and also keep a list of things I want to learn in the future [here](https://github.com/users/hugoppp/projects/5).

An archive of all of my university repos can also be found at [@hugopp-uni](https://github.com/hugoppp-uni)
