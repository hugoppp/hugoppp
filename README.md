## Hi there, I'm HugoðŸ‘‹ 
I am a passionate software dev who loves to learn new technologies, especially around .NET. I feel most at home with back-end development, but also love to write high-performance low-level code when the situation calls for it. C# is my favorite all-purpose language, as you can use it for both and have fun along the way

I am currently
- ðŸ“š Student for Computer Science for Technical Systems @HAW Hamburg
- ðŸ’¼ Software dev @OTTO
- :de: Living in Hamburg, Germany

I organize my repos into two orgs
1. All my university repos are public, they can be found at [@hugopp-uni](https://github.com/hugoppp-uni)
1. When I learn something in my free time, I put it into [@hugopp-learning](https://github.com/hugoppp-learning)
    - And I also keep a list of things I want to learn in the future [here](https://github.com/users/hugoppp/projects/2), suggestions are always welcome :)

#### ðŸ•– My most used languages since Feb 2021
